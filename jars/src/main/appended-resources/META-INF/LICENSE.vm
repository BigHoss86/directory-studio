APACHE DIRECTORY STUDIO SUBCOMPONENTS:

The Apache Directory Studio includes a number of subcomponents with
separate copyright notices and license terms. Your use of the source
code for the these subcomponents is subject to the terms and
conditions of the following licenses. 


Apache Directory Studio bundles a copy of ANTLR v2, which is distributed under
the following license:
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
ANTLR 2 License

We reserve no legal rights to the ANTLR--it is fully in the public domain. An 
individual or company may do whatever they wish with source code distributed 
with ANTLR or the code generated by ANTLR, including the incorporation of 
ANTLR, or its output, into commerical software.

We encourage users to develop software with ANTLR. However, we do ask that 
credit is given to us for developing ANTLR. By "credit", we mean that if you 
use ANTLR or incorporate any source code into one of your programs (commercial 
product, research project, or otherwise) that you acknowledge this fact 
somewhere in the documentation, research report, etc... If you like ANTLR and 
have developed a nice tool with the output, please mention that you developed 
it using ANTLR. In addition, we ask that the headers remain intact in our 
source code. As long as these guidelines are kept, we expect to continue 
enhancing this system and expect to make other tools available as they are 
completed.
