## Build from command line

You can use either of those two methods to build the project :

### Do it manually

1. Build the 'Eclipse Target Platform' and generate MANIFEST.MF files first

    mvn -f pom-first.xml clean install

2. Build the main eclipse artifacts using Tycho

    mvn clean install

### Use the script  (which does run the two previous commands)

On Linux / Mac OS X :

    $ ./build.sh

or on Windows :

    > build.bat

### Build issues

Tycho doesn't handle snapshot dependencies well. The first time a snapshot dependency is used within the build it is cached in `~/.m2/repository/p2`. Afterwards any change in the dependency (e.g. ApacheDS or LDAP API) is the considered unless it is deleted from the cache.


## Setup Eclipse workspace

Recommended IDE is 'Eclipse (Luna) for RCP Developers': <http://www.eclipse.org/downloads/packages/eclipse-rcp-and-rap-developers/lunasr1>

1. Import 'Eclipse Target Platorm' project first

    * File -> Import... -> Maven -> Existing Maven Projects
    * Choose 'studio/eclipse-target-platform' as root directory
    * Only this single project is selected
    * Finish

2. Initialize target platform

    * Open the `eclipse-target-platform.target` file with the 'Target Editor'
    * In the top right corner click 'Set as Target Platform'

3. Import the main plugins

    * File -> Import... -> Maven -> Existing Maven Projects
    * Chosse 'studio' as root directory
    * All the plugins are selected
    * Finish

During import some Maven plugin connectors need to be installed, accept the installation and restart.

## Run

### From command line

The build produces binaries for all platforms. Archived versions can be found in `product/target/products/`, unpacked versions can be found below `product/target/products/org.apache.directory.studio.product` 

### Within Eclipse

* Open the product configuration 'org.apache.directory.studio.product' with the Product Configuration Editor
* Click the link 'Launch an Eclipse application'


## Release

Generate help plugins
